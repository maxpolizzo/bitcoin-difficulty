### A strategy board game about Bitcoin mining and stacking sats, rocking Lightning wallets and packed with Bitcoin culture and education pills.

**Buy power stations and fire up your Bitcoin miners, hodl your hard-earned sats to survive through halvings, bear 
markets and difficulty adjustments, avoid getting rekt by black swans or government regulations and build the most 
profitable Bitcoin mining operation to win the game!**

Bitcoin Difficulty is about building a profitable Bitcoin mining operation to earn as many sats as possible while 
crushing the competition. To do so, players must acquire and operate power stations to power their Bitcoin miners and 
mine sats as their main source of income.

While growing their Bitcoin mining business, players must keep up with the total hash rate and difficulty adjustments, 
survive through halvings and Bitcoin price volatility, and avoid getting rekt by operational costs, black swans, 
government interventions, hacks or third-party bankruptcies.

While the most risk-averse will simply hodl their sats, others may try to time (or manipulate) the market by trading 
them for fiat bucks, or even hope to earn a so called "risk-free" yield by staking them on a centralized exchange. On 
the other hand, playing the fiat game could be a good strategy as the bank will print unlimited amounts of bucks to 
finance players who consistently honor their interest payments.
